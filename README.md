## Bike buyer Excel Dashboard

I have created this Microsoft Excel dashboard with the dataset that I downloaded from www.kaggle.com 
dataset. Where you can click on the slicer (On the left side of the Dashboard worksheet) to compare 
the data.

The dashboard consists of 4 worksheets;
1. bike_buyers (raw data)
2. Working Sheet (cleaned data)
3. Pivot Tables
4. Dashboard (Interactive)

In this data visualisions, I am are looking at the bike purchases that are made by married and 
single individuals across three regions in comparison with their level of education.
I am also looking their commuting distance based on their age bracket and their income avarage, 
so the store can determine and compare where do they make more sales and where they need more
marketing.
